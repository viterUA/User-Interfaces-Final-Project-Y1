# User Interfaces Final Project (Year 1)

**Project:** Marvel App Prototype

---

## Overview

This repository contains the design files and documentation for my Year 1 User Interfaces Final Project. Instead of building HTML/CSS from scratch, this project was created and prototyped using **Marvel** (a UI/UX design & prototyping tool). The goal was to explore interface design, user flows, and usability by building a realistic app prototype rather than a full frontend implementation.

---

## Purpose & Objectives

* **Design a user-centred app interface**: Apply principles of usability, accessibility, and visual hierarchy.
* **Prototype user flows**: Including onboarding/introduction, navigation, search functionality, and other core pages.
* **Test interactions & layout ideas** before committing to development.
* **Document design decisions**: Why certain layouts, button placements, colours, etc., were chosen.

## Contents of the Repository

Here’s what you’ll find:

| Item                          | Description                                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Home screen`                 | The home dashboard of the app, core navigation.                        |
| `Introduction Page`           | Onboarding / welcome screen introducing users to the app.              |
| `Page 2`, `Page 3`, `Page 4`  | Further screens illustrating different parts of the user flow.         |
| `Search page`                 | Interface for searching content / items within the app.                |
| `created elements`            | UI component parts, custom elements, icons, or reusable assets.        |
| `Final Project Document.docx` | The write-up: project plan, wireframes, design rationale, reflections. |

## Tools & Technologies

* **Marvel** – for designing high-fidelity prototypes and simulating interactions.
* **Design Assets** – custom icons, images, typography, colour palette (see `created elements`).
* *(Optionally add others if used: e.g. Sketch, Figma, Adobe XD, or resources used for icons/fonts)*

## How to View / Navigate the Prototype

1. Open the Marvel project via Marvel’s web app or mobile app.
2. Use the flow / navigation settings to move between screens.
3. Interact with clickable components (buttons, menu items) to simulate the user flow.

---

## Design Decisions & Reflections

* Colour scheme and typography were chosen to enhance readability and align with \[brand or aesthetic inspiration].
* The layout emphasises simplicity: minimal navigation, clear CTA (call-to-action) buttons, consistent margins and padding.
* Onboarding flow is designed to ease new users into the app without overwhelming them.
* Search functionality is central: accessible from almost every page.

---

## What’s not in this Project

* No production HTML/CSS or back-end functionality—this is purely design/prototype.
* Interactive data or dynamic content: placeholders are used where real data would be.
* Animations / transitions are basic or simulated via Marvel; not coded.

---

## How to Use / Build On This

If someone wanted to take this prototype further, they could:

* Extract assets (icons, images, colour specs) to build a style guide.
* Translate prototype screens into real front-end code (HTML, React, Flutter etc.).
* Add user testing: observe how people interact with prototype, collect feedback.
* Iterate designs to improve accessibility (contrast, font sizes, keyboard or screen-reader support).
