User Interfaces Final Project (Year 1)
Project: Marvel App Prototype

Overview

This repository contains the design files and documentation for my Year 1 User Interfaces Final Project. Instead of building HTML/CSS from scratch, this project was created and prototyped using Marvel (a UI/UX design & prototyping tool). The goal was to explore interface design, user flows, and usability by building a realistic app prototype rather than a full frontend implementation.

Purpose & Objectives

  Design a user-centred app interface: Apply principles of usability, accessibility, and visual hierarchy.
  Prototype user flows: Including onboarding/introduction, navigation, search functionality, and other core pages.
  Test interactions & layout ideas before committing to development.
  Document design decisions: Why certain layouts, button placements, colours, etc., were chosen.
  Contents of the Repository

Here’s what you’ll find:

  Item	Description
  Home screen	The home dashboard of the app, core navigation.
  Introduction Page	Onboarding / welcome screen introducing users to the app.
  Page 2, Page 3, Page 4	Further screens illustrating different parts of the user flow.
  Search page	Interface for searching content / items within the app.
  created elements	UI component parts, custom elements, icons, or reusable assets.
  Final Project Document.docx	The write-up: project plan, wireframes, design rationale, reflections.
Tools & Technologies

Marvel – for designing high-fidelity prototypes and simulating interactions.
Design Assets – custom icons, images, typography, colour palette (see created elements).

How to View / Navigate the Prototype
  Open the Marvel project via Marvel’s web app or mobile app.
  Use the flow / navigation settings to move between screens.
  Interact with clickable components (buttons, menu items) to simulate the user flow.

Design Decisions & Reflections

Colour scheme and typography were chosen to enhance readability and align with [brand or aesthetic inspiration].
  The layout emphasises simplicity: minimal navigation, clear CTA (call-to-action) buttons, consistent margins and padding.
  Onboarding flow is designed to ease new users into the app without overwhelming them.
  Search functionality is central: accessible from almost every page.
